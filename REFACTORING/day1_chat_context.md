# Day 1 Chat Context

## Session Information
- Date: 2025-01-06
- Refactoring Day: 1 of 5
- Focus: Foundation & Core Consolidation

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Project Setup
- Created comprehensive refactoring plan with 5-day timeline
- Established new directory structure for clean architecture
- Created backup location (manual backup recommended)

### 2. Core Daemon Refactoring
The notification daemon was completely rebuilt with proper architecture:
- **NotificationDaemon**: Main orchestrator class
- **NotificationData**: Type-safe dataclass for notifications  
- **DatabaseManager**: Handles all database operations with context managers
- **NotificationExtractor**: Safely extracts from macOS database
- **PriorityScorer**: Integrated scoring system with improved rules

Key improvements:
- Proper separation of concerns
- Type hints throughout
- Better error handling
- Configurable via arguments
- Clean signal handling for shutdown

### 3. Database Layer Foundation
- Created comprehensive data models with dataclasses
- Proper notification model with all fields
- MCP compatibility methods built-in
- Database operations use context managers

### 4. Feature Module Updates
- Priority scoring rewritten with better structure
- Templates module enhanced with:
  - Better category detection
  - Improved time formatting
  - Proper HTML escaping
  - Support for terminal, HTML, and Markdown output

### 5. Configuration System
Created centralized settings module with:
- Path management
- Environment variable support
- JSON configuration files
- Feature flags
- All constants in one place

### 6. Testing Foundation
- Unit tests for daemon components
- Feature tests for priority scoring and templates
- Proper test structure with setUp/tearDown
- Mock usage for external dependencies

### 7. Documentation
- Comprehensive architecture document
- Clear explanation of design decisions
- Extension points documented

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Dataclasses over dictionaries**: Type safety and better IDE support
2. **Context managers for DB**: Ensures connections are properly closed
3. **Modular scorer**: Rules organized by category with weights
4. **Template categories**: Auto-detected from factors and app IDs
5. **Centralized config**: All settings in one place with override support

## Current State

The foundation is solid with:
- Clean directory structure created
- Core daemon functionality refactored
- Database models defined
- Basic features migrated
- Test structure in place
- Configuration system ready

## Known Issues

1. Import paths need updating (Day 2 task)
2. MCP server not yet migrated
3. Some features still need copying
4. Requirements.txt not yet created
5. psutil dependency temporarily removed

## For Next Session

Day 2 will focus on:
1. MCP server consolidation
2. Database repository pattern
3. Remaining feature migrations
4. Import path updates
5. Integration testing
