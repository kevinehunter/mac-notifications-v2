# Day 4 Progress Context

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Morning Status Check
- Created Day 4 migration log
- Verified Day 3 completion status
- Confirmed test infrastructure and documentation in place

### 2. Installation Scripts
Created comprehensive installation and management scripts:
- `install.sh` - Main installation script with venv setup
- `start_daemon.sh` - Daemon startup script
- `stop_daemon.sh` - Daemon shutdown script
- `restart_daemon.sh` - Convenience restart script
- `create_launchd_plist.sh` - macOS LaunchD integration

### 3. Development Scripts
Created developer tooling:
- `setup_dev.sh` - Development environment setup
- `run_tests.sh` - Test execution script
- `lint.sh` - Code quality checks (black, flake8, mypy)
- `db_backup.sh` - Database backup utility
- `db_migrate.sh` - Database migration runner

### 4. Cleanup and Organization
- Created cleanup manifest documenting 100+ obsolete files
- Established ARCHIVE directory structure
- Moved sample files to archive for preservation
- Prepared for removal of old debug scripts, test files, and captures

### 5. Package Configuration
- Created `setup.py` with proper package metadata
- Split requirements into core (`requirements.txt`) and dev (`requirements-dev.txt`)
- Created `MANIFEST.in` for distribution
- Added entry points for daemon and server

### 6. Final Organization
- Created comprehensive `.gitignore`
- Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Added workflow for automated testing across Python versions

### 7. Documentation
- Created `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for users upgrading from v1
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` with v2.0.0 release notes
- Added MIT `LICENSE` file
- Added `.gitkeep` files for empty directories

## Architecture Improvements

### Script Organization
All scripts now centralized in `scripts/` directory:
- Installation and setup scripts
- Daemon management scripts
- Development tools
- Database utilities

### Package Structure
Proper Python package with:
- setup.py for pip installation
- Entry points for CLI commands
- Extras for development dependencies
- Clear dependency management

### CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions workflow:
- Tests on multiple Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
- Coverage reporting with codecov
- Runs on macOS (native environment)
